# WhatsApp Chat Analysis Project

## Overview
The **WhatsApp Chat Analysis project** applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to analyze chat data. It extracts meaningful insights such as top contributors, sentiment trends, spam detection, common topics, and conversation summaries. This project is ideal for identifying patterns in communication, visualizing trends, and gaining deeper insights into chat behaviors.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- **Export Chat:** WhatsApp provides a `.txt` export of chat history.
- **Preprocessing Steps:**
  - **Remove timestamps, emojis, and special characters.**
  - **Lowercase Conversion:** Standardize all text to lowercase.
  - **Tokenization:** Split sentences into individual words.
  - **Stopword Removal:** Eliminate common words (like “the,” “is”).
  - **Stemming/Lemmatization:** Reduce words to their root forms (e.g., "running" → "run").

**Example Code:**
```python
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
import re

def preprocess_message(message):
    message = re.sub(r'\\W+', ' ', message)  # Remove non-alphabetic chars
    tokens = message.lower().split()  
    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    
    return ' '.join([lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in tokens if word not in stop_words])
