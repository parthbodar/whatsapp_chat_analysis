WhatsApp Chat Analysis â€“ Project Overview
A WhatsApp Chat Analysis project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to extract meaningful insights from conversations. This project aims to uncover patterns such as message trends, user behavior, sentiments, spam detection, and common topics. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the project.

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
Export Chat: WhatsApp provides a .txt file of chat history (with or without media).
Preprocessing: Clean the data by:
Removing timestamps, special characters, and stopwords.
Tokenizing text and converting to lowercase.
Applying lemmatization or stemming to get root words.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze chat patterns:
Top Contributors: Identify users with the most messages.
Word Cloud: Visualize frequently used words.
Trends: Track daily or monthly message activity using time-series graphs.
Visual Tools: Use matplotlib, seaborn, or plotly for interactive charts.
3. Sentiment Analysis (NLP)
Determine the emotional tone of messages:
Polarity: Measure if a message is positive, negative, or neutral (using TextBlob or VADER).
Use Case: Track changes in sentiment over time to identify conflicts or happy conversations.
4. Topic Modeling (NLP)
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA): Identify underlying topics from chat messages.
Example: Extract topics like "movies," "work," or "travel" based on word co-occurrence patterns.
Output: Label each message with a dominant topic for better understanding.
5. Spam Detection / Message Classification (ML)
Use supervised learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to detect spam or categorize messages.
Text Vectorization: Convert chat messages into numeric features using TF-IDF or BERT embeddings.
Example: Predict whether a message is spam or contains specific keywords (e.g., reminders or jokes).
6. Chat Summarization (NLP)
Summarize long conversations using:
Extractive Summarization: Select key sentences (TextRank).
Abstractive Summarization: Generate new text using BART or T5 transformers.
Use Case: Provide quick summaries of large chat threads.
7. Dashboard & Visualization
Use Streamlit or Plotly Dash to build an interactive dashboard.
Include features such as:
Searchable chat history.
Graphs showing sentiment or message trends.
Topic-based filtering of conversations.
8. Conclusion
This project applies NLP (e.g., sentiment analysis, topic modeling, summarization) and ML (e.g., spam classification) to reveal patterns in chat data. Insights from this analysis can improve user understanding of conversations, detect spam, monitor emotional trends, and summarize lengthy chats efficiently. By deploying a dashboard, the project can become an interactive tool for personal or business use, providing deeper context into communication habits.
